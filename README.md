# Torus Knot Spline Cinema4D Plugin

**Create torus knot splines in Cinema4D (R.19)**

* [Installation](#installation)

*Based on [Three.js Torus Knot](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/geometries/TorusKnotGeometry.js)*

## Installation

First download the repo, and extract its content into a directory.

**Note**: Make sure to remove any previous installation of the plugins. It is also recommended to rename the directory into "TorusKnotSpline", as this will allow the plugin to be displayed under the name "TorusKnotSpline" instead of "torusknotspline-master" for instance.

To install the plugin, you should copy the newly extracted directory into the plugins folder, before restarting Cinema4D.
